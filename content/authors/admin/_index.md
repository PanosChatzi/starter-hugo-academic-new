I am a PhD candidate in exercise physiology at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. My research interests include oxygen transport and delivery, sports nutrition, exercise performance and fatigue. I am also passionate about programming with R and science communication.

In my project I am studying the redox effects of exercise and antioxidant supplementation on fatigue following a quantitative approach. My aim is to implement systems biology and computational methods in the field of exercise physiology.
